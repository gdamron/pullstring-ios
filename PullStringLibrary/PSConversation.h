/// The PSConversation object lets you interface with PullString's Web API.

/// To initiate a conversation, you call the start: method, providing

/// your API Key. The API Key will be remembered for future requests to
/// the same PSConversation instance.
///
/// The response from the Web API is returned as a PSResponse object,
/// which can contain zero or more outputs, including lines of dialog
/// or behaviors. You provide a completion block to receive the PSResponse
/// from the server when it is available.
///
/// You can send input to the Web API using the various sendXXX:
/// methods, e.g., use sendText: to send a text input string or
/// sendAudio: to send 16-bit LinearPCM audio data.
